## Method and Approach

Starting out writing full programs in JavaScript can be a very challenging endeavor â€” I used various online resources to help me along the way, which I have credited below. I spent a number of days just thinking about and sketching out my application and its pseudocode. I found that having a detailed list of what needed to appear on the page helped me research which methods I needed to familiarize myself with the most. Once I built out the skeleton API, I began to populate it with JavaScript. A majority of my time was spent troubleshooting with Live Server from the safety of my VS Code window.

## Credits
I followed sections of [this fantastic quiz-building tutorial](https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript) by James Q Quick to build out the gameplay for my web application.

The CSS layout was made using [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com) components, using direction from the [Bootstrap 4.0 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

I pulled questions from [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-quiz-set-1/) and [Tech Beamers](https://www.techbeamers.com/javascript-quiz-for-web-developers/) to populate my question array.
